# Sokoban game made with javafx

A sokoban game made with the javafx GUI API.
The game has two controller classes, one for the menu, one for the actual game.
The model is made with record classes.
The Map represents the JSON format it needs to be written in.
You can choose a Map and in the Menu, and it offers a preview of the Map you will play on.
The buttons on the left and right helps you pick between the maps.
Once the start button is hit, the game will begin, and you can start solving the puzzle.
The game uses arrows and 'WASD' for controls.
When the player makes contact with a stone, it pushes the stone, making it move instead of the player.
The puzzle is completed, once all the stones are pushed to each destination.
